# 🔧 SMS Gateway Delivery Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- ✅ Manual messages work both ways
- ✅ API calls successful (202 responses)
- ✅ SMS Gateway app shows "sent" in logs  
- ❌ Automated messages not delivering

## 🚨 Primary Suspect: RCS Messaging

### What is RCS?
- **Rich Communication Services** - "Chat" features in messaging apps
- Routes messages via **data/internet** instead of traditional SMS
- Can **interfere** with SMS Gateway apps

### 🔧 Turn OFF RCS Messaging

**Sean's Phone (Android):**
```
1. Open Messages app (Google Messages)
2. Tap the 3 dots (⋮) in top right
3. Go to "Settings"
4. Tap "Chat features" or "RCS chats"
5. Turn OFF "Enable chat features"
6. Restart phone
```

**Alternative path:**
```
Settings → Apps → Messages → Advanced → Chat features → OFF
```

## 🔧 Additional Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Set SMS Gateway as Default SMS App
```
📱 Sean's Phone:
Settings → Apps → Default apps → SMS app → Select "SMS Gateway"
```

### 2. Disable Battery Optimization
```
Settings → Battery → Battery optimization → SMS Gateway → Don't optimize
```

### 3. Check Carrier Filtering
```
💡 Automated messages might trigger spam filters
- Carriers filter "bulk" or "automated" messages
- Manual messages bypass these filters
- SMS Gateway messages might look "automated" to carriers
```

### 4. Message Format Testing
```
🧪 Test different message formats:
- Short messages vs long messages
- Plain text vs special characters
- Different sending patterns
```

### 5. Network Path Analysis
```
Manual Message Path:
Phone → Default SMS App → Carrier → Recipient

SMS Gateway Path:  
API → SMS Gateway App → Phone → Carrier → Recipient
```

## 🎯 Why RCS is the Top Suspect

**RCS Conflicts:**
- 📱 Tries to route via internet instead of SMS
- 🔀 Can hijack SMS routing
- 📡 Interferes with SMS Gateway apps
- ⚡ Manual messages bypass RCS logic
- 🚫 Automated messages get caught in RCS processing

**Common RCS Issues:**
- Messages show "sent" but never deliver
- Works for manual, fails for automated
- Carrier-dependent problems
- Different behavior on WiFi vs cellular

## 🧪 Test Plan After RCS Disable

1. **Turn OFF RCS messaging**
2. **Restart Sean's phone**
3. **Send immediate API test**
4. **Check delivery within 30 seconds**

## 🔧 Other Potential Issues

### Message App Conflicts
- Multiple messaging apps installed
- Default SMS handler conflicts
- Permission overlaps

### Carrier-Level Filtering
- Automated message detection
- Bulk message filtering  
- Spam prevention systems

### SMS Gateway App Configuration
- Not set as default SMS handler
- Background processing restrictions
- Permission conflicts
