## Why We're Making This Change

Due to issues with SMSMobileAPI (app crashes and unreliability), we're switching to **SMS Gateway** - a free, open-source alternative that allows us to continue using our personal phone numbers for client SMS communication.

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Completely FREE (no monthly costs)
- ✅ Uses your personal phone number
- ✅ More reliable than SMSMobileAPI
- ✅ Open source and actively maintained
- ✅ Privacy-focused (no data collection)

## Setup Instructions

### **REQUIREMENT: Android Phone**
⚠️ **SMS Gateway only works with Android devices** (not iPhone). If you don't have an Android phone, see options at the bottom.

### **Step 1: Install the App**
1. On your **Android phone**, go to **Google Play Store**
2. Search for: **"SMS Gateway"** by Aleksandr Soloshenko
3. Install the app (it's free)
4. Open the app

### **Step 2: Get Your Credentials**
1. On the app's **Home screen**, you'll see:
   - **Username**: (something like `user_abc123`)
   - **Password**: (auto-generated password)
2. **IMPORTANT**: Take a screenshot or write these down
3. Keep the app running in the background

### **Step 3: Send Your Credentials to Matt**
Email Matt your credentials in this format:
```
Name: [Your Name]
SMS Gateway Username: [your_username_from_app]
SMS Gateway Password: [your_password_from_app]
Phone Number: [your_phone_number]
```

### **Step 4: Test Your Setup**
Once Matt updates the system with your credentials:
1. You'll receive a test SMS from our system
2. Confirm you received it
3. Your phone is now integrated with our dialer system!

## Important Notes

### **Keep the App Running**
- The SMS Gateway app needs to stay running in the background
- Don't force-close it or your SMS integration will stop working
- The app uses minimal battery

### **Permissions**
- When first opening the app, grant all SMS permissions
- This allows the app to send messages on your behalf

### **If You Don't Have Android**
**Option 1: Borrow/Buy**
- Ask family/friends to borrow an Android phone
- Buy a cheap Android phone ($50-100) - even old models work

**Option 2: Team Sharing**
- If multiple team members don't have Android, we can share one device
- One person sets up the app, everyone uses that number as backup

**Option 3: Twilio Backup**
- We can set up Twilio as your backup (uses generic business numbers)
- Not as personal, but works immediately

## Troubleshooting

### **App Won't Install**
- Make sure you have a Google account signed in
- Check if your Android version is supported (most are)

### **Can't See Username/Password**
- Force-close and reopen the app
- Make sure you're on the "Home" screen
- Try restarting your phone

### **Messages Not Sending**
- Check if the app is still running
- Verify SMS permissions are granted
- Restart the app
