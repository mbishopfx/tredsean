  // SEO Psychology & Strategy
  "SEO Psychology: People trust Google's judgment. Being #1 makes you the automatic expert in their minds.",
  "The #1 Google result gets 28.5% of all clicks. Position #10 gets 2.5%. That's 1,140% more traffic at the top.",
  "Stop chasing algorithm updates. Build authority that Google can't ignore.",
  "Your competitors are buying ads. You should be dominating organic results.",

  "HTTPS isn't optional anymore. It's a ranking factor and trust signal.",
  
  // Content Strategy

  "Answer the question BEFORE your competition. Google rewards speed and relevance.",
  "Long-tail keywords = less competition, higher conversion rates.",
  "Topic clusters beat individual keywords. Think themes, not terms.",
  "Content that gets shared gets ranked. Make it worth spreading.",
  
  // Local SEO Mastery

  "Time on page tells Google your content delivers value.",
  "Click-through rates from search results influence rankings.",

  "What pages rank #1 for your target keywords? Reverse engineer them.",
  "Competitor backlink analysis reveals link opportunities.",
  "Price competition is for amateurs. Compete on authority.",
  "When competitors buy ads for your brand terms, you need better SEO.",
  
  // Voice Search & Future
  "Voice search queries are longer and more conversational. Optimize accordingly.",
  "Featured snippets capture position zero. That's above #1.",
  "People ask 'near me' questions. Be the local answer.",
  "AI search is coming. E-A-T (Expertise, Authority, Trust) matters more than ever.",
  "Visual search is growing. Optimize images like you optimize text.",
  
  // Business Psychology
  "SEO isn't just traffic - it's credibility. Rankings = trust in customers' minds.",
